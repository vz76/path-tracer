This is an implementation of path tracing: a method of rendering images through physically based global illumination for 3D scenes. Completed in collaboration with Luke Lu for CS354R: Computer Graphics Honors in Spring 2023.

The project features:

- Path tracing with Monte Carlo integration built upon a Whitted style ray tracer using Phong shading
- Usage of a BSDF to accurately depict diffuse, refractive, and reflective components in materials
- Implementation of a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) to accelerate spatial intersections
- Texture and cube mappings for objects and skyboxes
- Variety of antialiasing techniques in: box filter, stochastic supersampling, adaptive supersampling, n-rooks supersampling, multi-jittered supersampling
- Adaptive termination criterion for ray tracing based on photon contribution

Please consult ./path-report.pdf for additional information as well as a link to artifacts generated by the program.

Re-uploaded to minimize publicized code for the CS354R Ray Tracer assignment. Please contact me for any requested modifications.
